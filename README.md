## Counter Project

* The way this program works is that you can increase the number shown on the screen as much as you want and then save it. Every time you hit save, the value of the number you increased will be zero for a new increase.

* In this example, this program is used to count the bread sold by a bakery. Of course, it can be used for other purposes as well.

+ ***This program is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.***
